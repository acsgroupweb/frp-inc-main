We want to publicly express our gratitude and best wishes to Scott Rouse in his retirement from FRP!  Scott has continually practiced structural engineering for 39 years, including the last 29 with FRP.  He completed his career at FRP as Vice President and Chief Structural Engineer, where he had a significant impact on FRP in areas of project management, technical design and standards, and staff technical development.

It is difficult, if not impossible, to sum up Scott’s achievements over the many years of dedicated service. He has been a part of so many projects that have changed not only the Indianapolis skyline but many landscapes around the state of Indiana and beyond. Scott has worked in all markets and types of projects including hotels, city, county, state and federal government buildings, parking structures, education facilities, athletic facilities, churches, retail, industrial facilities, and commercial offices. 

Scott’s area of specialization included architecturally significant projects, vibration sensitive structures, fast track design, lateral analysis of complex structures, structural cost optimization, and constructability of structural/architectural systems interaction.

Some of Scott’s major projects include the Indianapolis Circle Center, , Victory Field, Bankers Life Fieldhouse, Indiana State Museum, Indianapolis Airport Midfield Terminal and Concourses, Indiana Convention Center Expansion, the new White River State Park Concert Stage Canopy, as well as multiple projects at universities all over Indiana and Kentucky.

Scott’s contributions will always be valued and remembered. His hard work, commitment, and dedication are worthy of all our admiration. Scott’s influence has been integral to our success and continuity. We are grateful that in his retirement he will continue as a Structural Technical Consultant to FRP. We wish Scott the best and hope that with no more deadlines he can fully enjoy his life passions! Congratulations Scott!!
