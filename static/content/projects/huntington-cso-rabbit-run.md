The City of Huntington constructed a new 2.25 MG CSO Storage Tank to reduce the volume and frequency of combined sewer overflows in their collection system. The new CSO storage tank is sized to capture a 1-year, 1-hour storm. New pumps are used to empty the CSO storage tank back to the influent of the WWTP after the storm event. 

FRP designed the buried, open-top, conventionally reinforced concrete tank for the facility.  The tank walls are nominally 35 feet tall and are braced at the top with concrete struts.   The groundwater buoyancy forces on the tank are resisted by rock anchors which are connected to the base slab at approximately 7 ft on center.
