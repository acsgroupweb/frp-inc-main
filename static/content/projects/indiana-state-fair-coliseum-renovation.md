The renovation of the Coliseum, a historic Indiana landmark, brought the building up to modern day standards and provided new and improved spectator comforts and amenities.  The renovation preserved the Coliseum\'s traditional exterior appearance, with the existing fa&#231;ade being repaired and restored.  The building\'s original interior construction had to be completely gutted.
 
New interior construction, consisting of approximately 200,000 square feet, includes an Event Level floor, two supported public concourses, and a new seating bowl, surrounding a new ice hockey floor.  The facility seats 6,400 for hockey and 8,300 for concerts.  The concourses were constructed with structural steel framing and composite slab floor construction.  The seating bowl was constructed with precast concrete.  Renovations also included a new center-hung video scoreboard and a modern sound system.
 
Immediately south of and adjacent to the Coliseum, a new approximately 20,000 square feet arena was constructed as part of this project.  The arena, which includes a second ice hockey floor, connects the coliseum and the existing South Pavilion of the Fairgrounds complex.
