The Hammond Courthouse is a new four-story limestone-clad building, located on a six-acre site in the City of Hammond, Indiana. A one-story terrace adjoins the building on the west side of the site. The building is aligned on a north-south axis with the primary entrance facing east. The entrance overlooks a landscaped area, which is the site for future expansion. A cafeteria is provided in the approximately 270,000 s.f. building.

Building occupants include the U.S. District Court, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Senate, and Congressional offices, the U.S. Attorney, the U.S. Marshals Service, the U.S. Trustees and the Social Security Administration.
