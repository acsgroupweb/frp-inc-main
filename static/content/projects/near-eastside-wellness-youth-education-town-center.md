As a part of the 2012 Super Bowl commitments, a new Youth Education Town Facility was constructed on the near east side of Indianapolis within the Arsenal Technical High School campus.  The facility was constructed to support the needs of the Near Eastside Community as well as the Arsenal Technical High School.

The design of the facility includes a gymnasium, fitness center, kitchen, administrative offices, lounges and several classrooms.  The building is a single story structure, consisting of steel columns, conventional structural steel framing and long-span joists.  The project includes several LEED elements such as a green house, a green roof, and green walls, all of which required special structural consideration.
