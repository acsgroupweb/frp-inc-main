The Advanced Manufacturing Center of Excellence (AMCE) is shared by Indiana University-Purdue University Columbus, Ivy Tech Community College, and Purdue College of Technology. It contains classrooms, teaching laboratories, and support services for students and employees pursuing education and training in advanced manufacturing and technology-related careers. The facility allows education, workforce and business development programs to increase the productivity and competitiveness of the manufacturing sector in Southeast Indiana. The state-of-the-art AMCE facility provides students with the opportunity to pursue education built around a curriculum of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM)

The structural frame consists of exposed structural steel and metal deck. Particular attention was given to the architecturally exposed aspects of the steel and concrete floor.
