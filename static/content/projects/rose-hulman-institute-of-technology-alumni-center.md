The Rose-Hulman Alumni Center consists of a 200 meter indoor track, three intramural basketball courts with provisions for volleyball and tennis, a varsity competition arena, a natatorium built to NCAA standards, racquetball courts, a weight room, locker rooms and showers, totaling nearly 160,000 square feet.

The project was driven by a very aggressive fast-track schedule due to long lead times for structural steel delivery.  The structural steel packages were released a full three months prior to the final architectural and MEP packages.  All structural packages were delivered on time and well under the Construction Manager\'s total budget.
