This museum houses a broad collection of native American and Western American art. An award-winning building, it reflects the mass and color common in adobe and pueblo architecture, yet with a more monolithic character and monumental sense of scale. The museum includes permanent galleries to display the extensive collection of paintings, sculptures, weapons, ceremonial objects, costume masks and other historic artifacts, a gallery to accommodate traveling exhibits, collection storage, other support areas, and a gift shop.

Project Details: Size 80,000 GSF | Project Completion 1990
