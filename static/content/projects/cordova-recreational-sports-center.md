The demolition of a portion of the original building made room for more than double the amount of existing fitness space for the newly expanded Cordova Recreational Sports Center. Other added program elements included three basketball courts, four volleyball courts, a unique indoor sports turf facility, and a multi purpose warm water aquatics pool for fitness and recreation purposes. A rock climbing and bouldering wall were also added to the facility.

The new plan provides a multi-level lobby that brings natural light deep into the heart and lower levels of the building. A new walking/jogging track located over the central lobby space provides views of both indoor activity spaces and outside to the Purdue campus.

Structural challenges for the project included tying the addition into the existing construction which consists of a flat plate concrete frame with virtually no lateral system. The new addition was designed to provide enough seismic lateral resistance to brace both the new and existing portions of the building. 

The project was anticipated to be certified for the US Green Building Council LEED criteria.
