Located at 17th Street and Woodlawn Avenue, the 30,000-square-foot building has restrooms, locker rooms, storage space and multiple rehearsal rooms. One of those rehearsal rooms is large enough for all the band's 300 members, allowing Woodley to still have practice, even when it rains.

Named after a former band director, the Ray E. Cramer Marching Hundred Hall has an 8,000-square-foot rehearsal space. The room is soundproof and has two projection screens and a closed-circuit TV system, so groups in smaller rehearsal rooms, such as the Red Steppers dance team, can see what the band is doing. The two groups collaborate for performances at football games.
