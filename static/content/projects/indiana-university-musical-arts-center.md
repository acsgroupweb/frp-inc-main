A historically significant project for FRP, the Musical Arts Center  on the campus of Indiana University is considered a world class opera theatre. The stage was designed to be equivalent to the New York Metropolitan Opera House with the ability to share shows with exactly the same sets. The facility includes a ten story fly system,  a two level orchestra pit, extensive carpentry shops, textile production facilities, practice rooms, dressing rooms, and classroom space. This project represents one of FRP\'s earlier forays into signature architectural projects. The brutalist architectural style features extensive exposed concrete structural elements inside and outside the facility.
