The Student Housing Complex includes 508 apartments with 4 bedroom units containing single-private bedrooms. Each of the six housing buildings is three or four stories, and is framed with engineered lumber, wood I-joists, and metal plate connected wood trusses, with panelized wood walls used for vertical and lateral support. Located near the middle of the housing complex is a Village Center building containing laundry, convenient store, offices and lounge spaces. The Village Center is framed with conventional steel and wood I-joists.

The housing component is located on the east side of Hinkle, surrounding the existing Butler Football Field (Butler Bowl). The project also included improvements to the existing football facility and surrounding campus landscape.
