The Marian University Center for Student Success is a welcoming, multi-use campus destination that includes a dining facility, expanded gymnasium and fitness area, and renovated areas for classrooms and offices.

The project consists of multiple areas of renovated and new construction.  All new construction being built adjacent to existing buildings and additions dating from 1948 to 2007.  The one-story dining area is a structural steel \"X\" braced building with joists and joist girders.  The pre-engineered metal building gymnasium was expanded and includes a second-level structural steel concourse.  The new two-story structural steel fitness area ties into the concourse.  

The two-story Hall of Champions entry connects the areas and gives the students, faculty, and visitors a memorable place to connect, gather and grow.
