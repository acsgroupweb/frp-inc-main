The Children\'s Museum Parking Garage project came out of the need for a multi-level parking facility to improve the \"arrival experience\" for visiting families. The design team was challenged with conflicting circulation paths of cars, large service vehicles, school tour buses, and pedestrians, which lead them to design a more concentrated and separated flow pattern for visitor cars. The new four-level, 900-space parking garage allows visitors to access a pedestrian bridge over Illinois Street.
