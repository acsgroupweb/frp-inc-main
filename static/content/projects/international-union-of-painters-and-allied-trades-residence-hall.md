The International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT) Residence Hall is part of the IUPAT national headquarters complex which also includes the IUPAT National Headquarters Building and the IUPAT National Training Center Building. The residence hall serves as a hotel with 36 guest suites for visiting trainees and visiting union executives. This three-story building has reception and lobby spaces on the first floor.

The structural system for the residence hall is a long-span composite slab on steel deck spanning approximately 14\'-0\' supported on cold-formed steel stud bearing walls. The lateral forces due to wind and seismic loading are resisted by steel stud shear walls with steel flat strap bracing on each face of the shear walls.
