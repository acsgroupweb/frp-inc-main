The building houses an auditorium, large and small classrooms, and administrative and faculty office space. It consists of a five story west wing and a three story east wing connected by a central glass foyer with monumental stair.

The west wing framing is situated along a curved longitudinal axis, while the east wing consists of two adjoining trapezoids with separate grid systems, requiring special attention during design, detailing and construction considerations for the reinforced concrete frame. The facade is a highly intricate blending of various stone types and curtain wall.
