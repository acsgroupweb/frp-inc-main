On game days, the south end zone provides an architecturally distinctive main entry to the stadium, and a connection to the 360-degree concourse.  The south end zone also includes club seating, a large spectator terrace, ribbon boards, sound system and a 91\' x 42\' video board.

Year round the facility serves as the home of the Excellence Academy for IU student athletes and includes sports medicine, hydrotherapy, academic study and counseling, and nutrition.  The second floor features The Hoosier Room, a student athlete dining facility overlooking the field.

The structural design included multiple transfer girders, to accommodate truck access to the field, loading dock access and other interior space requirements.
