The project consisted of a new track and soccer complex, field hockey and lacrosse complex, sand volleyball area, and improvements to the existing sports complex.  The existing complex received a new grandstand with 4,000 seats, along with a team meeting room, visitor\'s locker room, and new concessions and restrooms.  The superstructure is constructed totally from precast concrete elements produced locally, and is supported on a drilled pier system supported by bedrock.
