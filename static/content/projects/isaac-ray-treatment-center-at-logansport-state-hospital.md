The Issac Ray Treatment Center is Indiana's premiere forensic evaluation and treatment facility and provides specialized care for both men and women.  This state-of-the-art treatment facility meets current standards of care and security with substantial improvements to the therapeutic environment while enhancing the quality of life for patients.

The building materials used for the facility were selected to be environmentally friendly.  Due to programmatic requirements of the building, over 310,000 concrete blocks were utilized in its construction.  The block which was manufactured locally (within 2 miles of the site) has a recycled content of 46.5% by weight.  Other building materials were selected due to their recycled content, local or regional availability, or their use of low emitting materials, such as the Agrifiber Products used for all interior casework construction.

The structural system is made up of CMU load bearing walls and structural steel plus metal bar joist roof framing.  Efficient use of the CMU walls was accomplished by also using them as the lateral load resisting system eliminating a significant amount of structural steel that would have been required.
