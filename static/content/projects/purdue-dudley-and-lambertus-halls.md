This facility will accommodate the projected growth of Purdue\'s College of Engineering and the Purdue Polytechnic Institute.  Consisting of two connected buildings, the complex will increase both the quality and quantity of project-based instruction space and teaching labs, as well as provide more design studios, collaborative spaces, and administrative office space.

The structural system is a conventionally reinforced cast-in-place concrete frame, comprised of five elevated floor levels over a basement.  After extensive studies and considerations of vibrations, loading criteria, and mechanical clearance requirements a hybrid concrete framing solution was selected.  Two-way flat slabs are used in portions where offices will be located and one-way slabs to post tensioned beams at the larger spans required at the labs and instructional spaces.

The project documents were delivered under multiple bid issuance packages with early demolition, temporary earth retention, foundation and concrete framing all issued prior to the rest of the design team packages.
