The 24-story tower includes a luxury hotel with luxury condominiums above the hotel along with high-end retail space and parking on the lower levels.

The below grade level consists of mechanical space as well as parking. The parking is accessed through the adjacent Circle Block Parking Garage. The first level of the hotel consists of the lobby and lounge as well as retail space. Meeting space and the ballroom are on level two with hotel parking on the third and fourth levels. Hotel back of house functions and mechanical functions occur on the fifth level. A pool and spa are located on level six along with the first guest rooms. Above are 11 additional guest room floors. The top of the tower houses six levels of luxury condominiums. 

The structural system for the hotel is a cast-in-place concrete frame. The typical hotel and condominium levels are post-tensioned flat plates. The southwest corner of the tower cantilevers over the existing Arts Garden, which spans the intersection of Washington and Illinois Streets.
