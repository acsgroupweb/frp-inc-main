Phase II of the Water Systems Improvements for the City of Lawrence involved structural design work at two plant locations - the Fort Harrison Plant and the Indian Lake Plant.  FRP provided final structural design for Wessler Engineering for the foundations of a new steel detention tank, a new filter building, repairs to an existing 100-yr-old concrete reservoir, a new storage building, a new backwash tank, and an addition to an existing filter building.
