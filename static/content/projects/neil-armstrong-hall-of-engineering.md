The Neil Armstrong Hall of Engineering building\'s driving force is to create environments that demonstrate and enable team based, multidisciplinary learning.  Programmatically, this concept is delivered through three Team Learning Modules (TLM).  Each TLM contains all the resources a student team would require to design, develop, build, and test a project.  In addition to the TLM\'s, the Armstrong Engineering Hall houses the departments of Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering, Materials Science Engineering, Engineering Administration, and general University classrooms.
  
The building consists of a 3-story cast-in-place concrete frame with a structural steel mechanical penthouse plus a basement and partial sub-basement.  An elaborate cantilevered steel roof truss encompasses it all.  An elevated tiered lecture room, an exposed concrete bridge at two levels through the atrium, and three concrete stairs are some of the interesting structural elements within the building
