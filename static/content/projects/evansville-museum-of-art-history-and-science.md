The Evansville Museum of Art, History and Science project included 64,000 square feet of new addition and renovation to the existing facility. The expansion features a 48 foot, two and one half story, open glass Pavilion with a spherical immersive theater located partially within the Pavilion space and partially outside the building envelope. Within the space is a museum shop and a 2nd story mezzanine that houses a learning center, office and conference areas. This new expansion space provides a greater range of program opportunities for schools and businesses in the region as well as the ability to accommodate film screenings, lectures, group meetings, teleconferencing and remote astronomical observations.

The new addition was constructed using structural steel framing and utilized special ductile steel moment frames for the lateral system with special detailing for seismic design category D.
