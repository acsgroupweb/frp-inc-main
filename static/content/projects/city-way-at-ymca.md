The YMCA at City Way is a full service YMCA. The building includes a three court gymnasium, fitness areas, two indoor pools, community space, retail space and support functions. An elevated running track is located above and around the gymnasium. The structural system is a composite structural steel braced frame. Special attention was required for the design of the gymnasium and fitness areas for vibration control since they occur on the second floor supported structure.
