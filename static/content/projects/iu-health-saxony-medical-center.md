The IU Health Saxony Medical Center is a three-story steel frame structure constructed over a partial basement level.  The floors consist of composite steel beams supported by steel columns.  Concrete shear walls provide support for lateral wind and seismic forces.  Concrete shear walls were used to provide minimal obstructions for future renovations.  There is also a free standing steel frame Central Plant building that houses many hospital utilities.  The Central Plant is a single-story steel X-braced frame with a small mezzanine, framed with composite steel beams.
