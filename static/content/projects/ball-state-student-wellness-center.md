The project consists of a major addition to the existing sport recreational facilities at Ball State University. This project houses space for the following: gymnasium, sports forum, fitness rooms, performance space, elevated running track, climbing wall, outdoor pursuits, activity spaces, and refreshment service. 

The project called for the removal of the existing Irving Gymnasium to allow for a new addition adjacent to existing facilities. The addition is a structural steel structure exposed long span trusses to allow for a large gymnasium clear span. Diagonal steel braced bays constitute the lateral load resisting system. An elevated running track encircles the new addition. Some renovation to the existing gymnasium and other adjacent space was also required.
