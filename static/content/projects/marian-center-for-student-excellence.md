The Marian Center for Student Excellence is a welcoming, multi-use campus destination that includes a dining facility, expanded gymnasium and fitness area, and renovated areas for classrooms and offices.  The project consists of multiple areas of new construction, and renovation of buildings dating from 1948 to 2007.  The one-story dining area is a structural steel braced building with joists and joist girders.  The existing pre-engineered metal building gymnasium was expanded and includes a new second-level structural steel concourse, which ties into the new two-story building with the fitness area.  The two-story Hall of Champions entry connects the areas and gives the students, faculty, and visitors a memorable place to connect, gather and grow.
