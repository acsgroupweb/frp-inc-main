The Bankers Life Fieldhouse (formerly Conseco Fieldhouse) features a retro-style appearance evoking memories of traditional Indiana basketball fieldhouses, complemented by state-of-the-art amenities. An exciting design dominates the Fieldhouse interior. The project was completed under an extremely aggressive fast-track schedule requiring the foundations to be constructed well before the design of the superstructure was complete. The facility includes two suite and two concourse levels.

The structure upper concourse serves as a special tension ring to support and constrain the roof arches, saving considerable tonnage in the roof structure.

Project Details: Seats 18,500 | Project Completion 1999 | FRP Services: Structural Engineer of Record for the entire facility, excluding main roof over the seating bowl.
