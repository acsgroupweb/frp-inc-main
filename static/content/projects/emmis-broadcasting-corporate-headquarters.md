The Emmis building is located on Monument Circle, and is composed of four distinct facades: the Emmis \"tower\", the forecourt entry fa&#231;ade, the modern glass curtain wall, and the \"journal\" fa&#231;ade. Each fa&#231;ade represents something from the history of Monument Circle or the future of Emmis Broadcasting.

FRP performed the structural design for the 8-story Emmis Broadcasting corporate headquarters. In an effort to maintain the unique architectural look of the Circle, an existing 4-story building is incorporated in the design, blending the historic with the new. The Emmis Building consists of several building levels which have office areas, terraces, a gallaria. The facility also includes a 3-story entry with an atrium on the lower level and a 4-story atrium on the upper level.
