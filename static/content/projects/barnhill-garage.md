This project consists of a five level, 1314 car parking garage and three stair/elevator towers and is located on the campus of IUPUI. The fascia for the parking garage consists of concrete bumper walls and a red cedar grille between bumper walls. The fascia for the stair towers consists of brick and window wall.

A cast-in-place concrete, post-tensioned frame was selected due to its superior durability, better security as a consequence of better light dispersion, and enhanced driver comfort. Microsilica concrete was used for all post-tensioned concrete parking levels to increase durability.
