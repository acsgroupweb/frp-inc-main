The Eugene and Marilyn Eye Institute is the new home of the Indiana University School of Medicine Department of Ophthalmology.  The four story facility houses the adult outpatient clinic, ophthalmology classrooms, an optional shop, a basic science research center, faculty and administrative offices, graduate student meeting rooms and space for program expansion.  The Eye Institute consolidates the three missions of the Department of Ophthalmology, patient care, research and education, in a modern building of colorful glass, brick and limestone.  Nearly half of the building is dedicated to research space, allowing for an increase in the number of faculty, doubling the researchers and physicians dedicated to finding solutions to vision loss.  The building was designed to meet the U.S. Green Building Council\'s LEED Gold specification by wing energy efficient systems and building materials.
