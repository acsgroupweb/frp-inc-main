Fink Roberts & Petrie, Inc. provided structural design services for the $218 million expansion to the Knauf Fiberglass manufacturing facilities in Shelbyville, Indiana. The new plant facilities more than doubled their original fiberglass production capabilities. This project included a new 374,000 square foot warehouse facility, a new Binder/Utility building, a new building for new manufacturing lines 611 through 614, a new manufacturing building for manufacturing Loose Fill fiberglass insulation, and a new Loose Fill Bagging tower.  Structural modifications to existing buildings, conversion of existing pre-engineered warehouse structures into manufacturing facilities, yard structures such as utility arbors, stack foundations, equipment foundations, and a new Cullet Storage Facility were also part of this project.

This project was challenging due to the limited site, existing underground utilities and old foundations, underpinning requirements of existing building foundations adjacent to new construction, requirements for additions and modifications to existing buildings and the aggressive schedule.

FRP continues to provide structural engineering services for Knauf plants in Shelbyville, IN, Lanett, AL, Albion,  MI, and Inwood, WV
