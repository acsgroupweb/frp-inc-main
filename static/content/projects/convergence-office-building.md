This facility accommodates retail, open and preconfigured offices, meeting, and event spaces. The structure core and shell construction was fast-tracked. The structural system is a structural steel frame, with five elevated floor levels. An extensive deflection and vibration analysis was performed for the long spanning steel girders with multiple mechanical pipe penetrations. The facility achieved the LEED Silver certification.
