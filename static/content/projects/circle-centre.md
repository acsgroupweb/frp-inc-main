The Circle Centre project consists of the redevelopment of 3 1/2 existing city blocks in downtown Indianapolis. The redevelopment encompasses integration of existing and new buildings into a complex of retail, parking, and entertainment uses. The project was constructed on a very aggressive fast track schedule. The structural steel was released approximately 6 months prior to the bulk of the architectural and M/E/P packages.
