The Wilmeth Active Learning Center building was designed to meet Purdue\'s commitment to active learning.  The facility supports small group work, use of evolving technologies, and other classroom innovations for both small and large class sizes. 

Large first floor classrooms are accommodated by concrete transfer girders that span 80 feet.  Several structural components remain architecturally exposed and are prominently featured in the architectural interior design scheme including concrete columns, concrete beams, central monumental stair, and structural steel trusses at the reading room.
