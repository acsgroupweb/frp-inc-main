This facility accommodates program space for academic office suites, faculty offices, classrooms, teaching labs, interview suites, conference rooms, computer labs, and collaborative spaces. 

Extensive lateral analysis was conducted of the irregular-shaped structure with multiple roof elevations.  A vibration analysis was performed to maintain acceptable levels of peak velocities of the cantilever floor framing supporting the monumental stairs overlooking the atrium. The facility achieved the LEED Gold certification.
