The $15.75 million second phase is under construction now and will accomplish the State Park\'s goal of bringing a permanent concert venue to the 250-acre downtown park when it\'s finished in June. In addition to the stage, the park is also adding a concrete pad for 3,000 permanent seats, artist amenities and 40 more restrooms.

The permanent stage will offer better visual and production capabilities with two new LED video screens on each side. And the permanent seats will provide a more comfortable option for visitors who prefer not to sit in the grass.

Another new attraction for artists will be the 4,000-square-foot amenities building adjacent to the stage that will have dressing rooms, showers and production offices. Currently, artists have to use trailers next to the stage.
