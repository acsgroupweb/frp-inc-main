Victory Field is a state-of-the-art baseball facility in downtown Indianapolis and home of the Triple A Indianapolis Indians.  The ballpark accommodates approximately 15,000 fans, 2,000 of which can enjoy the game in the outfield family picnic area.  The ballpark includes an indoor pitching and hitting area, administrative offices, suites and comfortable clubhouses for both competing teams.  The park\'s opening game was July 11, 1996.

The budget was met in large part to FRP\'s cost-effective design.  A major feature of FRP\'s design were the trusses, the structural steel elements most readily seen, which were detailed with light, slender members.  They were shop welded rather than bolted to save on the high fabrication costs of bulky gusset plates at each connection.  The top and bottom chords have relatively light T sections connected with shop welded, double-angle diagonals, eliminating the need for the large gusset plates yet maintaining the architect\'s desired appearance.
