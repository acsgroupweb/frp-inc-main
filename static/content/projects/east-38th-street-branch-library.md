The modern design features a triangular shaped plan maximizing the building\'s presence and visibility. The structural roof framing system consists of economical low weight structural steel and joists with diagonal bracing between the slab on grade level and roof framing for lateral resistance. The multi-level roof allows light to enter the interior spaces through clerestory glazing between the high and low levels.
