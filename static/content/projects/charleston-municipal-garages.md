The Charleston Municipal Parking Garages involved two facilities: the Summers Street Garage (720 cars on 7 levels) and the Shanklin Parking Garage (525 cars on 4 levels). Each garage consists of a pretopped, precast concrete frame with cast-in-place concrete pour strips. This system was selected for the durability of its driving surface as well as its economical initial construction cost. Each parking garage has one structurally independent stair/elevator tower framed in structural steel.
