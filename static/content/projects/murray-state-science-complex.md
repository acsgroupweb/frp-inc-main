The project is the second phase of a three phase science complex on the campus of Murray State University in Kentucky.  It consists of two levels of chemistry laboratory and classroom space.  A two story atrium with monumental stairs is included in the building space.  The project also includes a 3,000 sq. ft. connector between the Chemistry and Biology buildings.

The building is designed based on the seismic criteria of the 2000 International Building Code which is Seismic Design Category D.  The lateral system consists of a specially reinforced moment frame to maximize the ductility of the structure.  A reinforced cast-in-place concrete frame was selected for the structural system in order to minimize floor vibrations during microscope usage in the research labs.
