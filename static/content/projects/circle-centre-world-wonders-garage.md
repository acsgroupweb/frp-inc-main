Constructed through a design/build contract, this eight level, 1500-car garage utilized precast concrete as both structural and architectural elements, allowing the garage to be built in 12 months and thus available for occupancy when the mall opened. The brick faced elevator tower and other brick faced portions of the fa&#231;ade, combine with the arched openings that announce the entrances to provide visual relief and scale to the building mass. Glass backed elevators and an open stair tower imparting a sense of openness, diminish security concerns that always seem to be an issue in urban settings.
