The Howard L. Schrott Center for Performing and Visual Arts is the final component of the Jordan College of Fine Arts complex at the main entrance to Butler University. Located just east of Clowes Memorial Hall, the Schrott Center provides performance and exhibition space for Butler\'s theater, dance, music and visual arts.

The project consists of a 450-seat performance and academic theater with a proscenium stage. Also included are lobby spaces, vestibules, dressing rooms, catwalks, an orchestra pit and mechanical spaces. The approximate area of the project is 31,000 GSF with a small partial basement to house the orchestra pit and its support spaces. 

The structural system combines a structural steel frame and composite floor construction with load bearing and lateral load resisting precast concrete sandwich panels.

The project was designed to achieve Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification as a green building.
