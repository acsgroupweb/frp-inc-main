The four-story apartment complex provides market rate units to downtown Fort Wayne directly across from Park View Field, home of the Tin Caps minor league baseball team. Resident parking is provided in a secured centrally located parking garage that is topped with a green roof and swimming pool for secluded resident access. The eastern upper floors and balconies provide views of the adjacent baseball field. Standalone three-story townhomes with individual two car garages provide individual home ownership within the complex.

The first-floor podium is framed with post tensioned cast-in-place concrete. The upper floors of the apartment are framed with cost effective conventional wood framed construction. Due to multiple previous buildings located on the site, aggregate pier soil improvement was utilized to allow for shallow foundations. 

Project Details: 163 Apartment Units | 14 Townhomes | 276 Parking Spaces
