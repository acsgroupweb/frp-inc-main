The new Indiana University Grand Carillon replaced and relocated the former tower on the IU Bloomington campus. The structure accommodates 65 bells weighing a total of 44 tons. The tower is comprised of six primary limestone piers accented by a series of smaller vertical fins to complete the radial framework. Horizontal rings of structural steel ties the tower together to form an overall composite column for lateral resistance.
