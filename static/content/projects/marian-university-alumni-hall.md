Marian University\'s Alumni Hall functions as central gathering spot for students, alumni, faculty, and visitors on campus. Known as the campus \"living room\", students are engaged inside and out by a full height curtain wall of windows around two sides of the facility. It contains a banquet hall, a dining hall, a coffee shop, a campus bookstore, and a full catering kitchen.

An extremely slender roof edge profile at the end of a fifteen-foot cantilevered condition requires specially fabricated tapered profiles of the structural steel roof framing. There are a low and a high roof structural steel framing levels allowing natural light to enter between through a system of clerestory glazing. Discrete locations were selected for lateral bracing so as not to compromise the views through the perimeter curtain wall, and maintain the open room concept.
