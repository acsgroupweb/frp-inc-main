The project consists of video board improvements at Ross Ade Stadium.
The new video board project for Purdue's Ross Ade Stadium consisted of the demolition of the existing videoboard and associated structure in the south end zone, and replacement with a new videoboard and support structure.  The new videoboard structure was designed to accommodate the future construction of the planned south end zone (SEZ) structure.
