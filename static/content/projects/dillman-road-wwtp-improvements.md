The Dillman Road Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) Upgrade & Efficieny Improvements project involved an increase in annual average capacity from 15 mgd to 20 mgd and peak flow capacity from 30 mgd to 40 mgd to meet 20-year flow projections. It is also included replacement of select process, electrical and mechanical equipment and components.

FRP performed structural design for a new Disk Filter Building, a new walkway above one of the aeration tanks, assisted with miscellaneous modifications within the Aeration and Digestion Structure pipe gallery, and modification to the roof, floor and exterior walls of the Electrical Building.
