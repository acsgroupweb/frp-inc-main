The Hyatt House/Hyatt Place, also referred to as the Dual Hyatt, is located in the downtown Indianapolis historic Wholesale District adjacent to Georgia Street\'s pedestrian boardwalk and across from Banker\'s Life Fieldhouse.  It is a mixed-use development comprised of a 15-story building which houses the 310 key dual branded hotel, restaurants, retail space, and underground parking.

The post tensioned concrete, two -way flat plate upper floors step back from a two-story concrete podium base allowing for an outdoor terrace restaurant at the second floor and giving more distance to the neighboring housing.  Monumental concrete stairs lead to the building\'s unique layout with a large, single lobby on the second level.  The 15-floor amenity deck offers an open-air terrace and indoor pool.  The underground parking is accessed below Chesapeake Street from the adjacent new parking garage, and allows entrance to the existing building to the west below grade.
