The hotel project consisted of a remodel of an existing six-story hotel and the construction of a new, adjoining nine story hotel for a total of 333 keys in downtown Louisville. 

The new hotel construction consists of concrete post tensioned floor slabs and a structural steel roof. The concrete columns are founded upon auger cast piles and concrete pile caps. The first story construction has a taller story height as it provides parking area and a drive aisle to a new three story precast concrete parking garage that was also part of the project.
