The Indianapolis Zoo Bicentennial Pavilion is designed to host a variety of activities, including concerts, picnics, private events, and even a live bird exhibition, the Magnificent Macaws. The timber structure is intended to evoke the tree canopies of the world\'s rain forests.

The 40,000 square feet of open framing can accommodate and shelter groups up to 1,000 seated people. There are eleven pods supported by exposed structural steel trunks with large cantilevered glulam timber girders for the canopy. Each pod consists of 63 individual wood beams, ranging from 83 feet long and 19,000 pounds to just three feet and 25 pounds. Translucent roofing materials allows sunlight to filter through to the ground below.
