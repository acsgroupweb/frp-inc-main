This building was designed to provide researchers with an environment for scientific preeminence and a world class teaching facility. The project consists of two primary components, a three story research and classroom building and a livestock processing facility with teaching labs and a retail component. 

Parametric studies were performed to compare costs of structural steel and cast-in-place concrete framing systems. A structural steel system was selected based on current market conditions at the time. Vibration sensitive equipment such as microscopes are limited only to specific bays on each floor to increase economy.

The livestock processing portion of the project dictated special concrete wall and slab design for cooling, freezing, and cleaning. Overhead monorail systems to move the product throughout the space are accommodated by the structural frame. A \"county fair\" type show pavilion is a distinct architectural feature of the project with exposed structural steel truss roof framing.

Project Details: Size 124,000 GSF | Project Completion 2018
