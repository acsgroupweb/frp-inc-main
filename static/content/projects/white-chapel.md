The chapel provides a place of prayer and meditation for the Rose-Hulman campus community. The facility is located on the western edge of the larger of two campus lakes.  The chapel is composed of a wedge-shaped nave supported by an entry way, counseling offices and other facilities to accommodate special events. Diamond shaped stainless steel panels clad the exterior of the arched roof. The shell is split by a series of vertical ribbon windows and a continuous ridge skylight.

The exposed structural steel frame is made up of curved tube members.  Since the radius varies from bent to bent, particular attention was given to details to accommodate the complex surface shape of the shell. The surface is curved in one direction while it tapers down from front to back.
