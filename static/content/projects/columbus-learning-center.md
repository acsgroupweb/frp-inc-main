The Learning Center for Columbus, Indiana is intended to serve the continuing education needs of the community for people of all ages. The project consists of high tech classrooms, library, food services, an auditorium and administrative office space.

The building serves as a bridge between the existing Ivy Tech and IUPUC buildings on the campus. A curved glass enclosed spine serves as a public pedestrian street connecting the two facilities. The structural system consists of a concrete flat slab for the second floor with a structural steel roof system above. Much of the structural system is exposed, which requires careful coordination with the architectural design.

Project Details: Size 130,000 GSF | Project Completion 2003
