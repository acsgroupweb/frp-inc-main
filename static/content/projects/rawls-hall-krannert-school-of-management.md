The Krannert Management Classroom and Distance Learning Facility (Jerry S. Rawls Hall) at Purdue University is a four story structure housing the management school\'s graduate program. The building includes large classrooms and lecture halls, along with student meeting rooms, and administrative and staff offices. A large entry foyer creates ample public space on the main level.   A glass enclosed, structural steel arched roof penthouse rests in the center of the roof providing natural light into the interior atrium space.  The existing Krannert School of Management Building is connected to Rawls Hall by a new structural steel pedestrian bridge at the fourth floor.
