This two-story structure includes 100 foot long steel trusses to create a large column free space. Vertical steel x-bracing is used to create an economical lateral support system. The large ballroom for exhibit space can be subdivided into as many 6 smaller spaces for tenant use through the use of operable wall panels. The 6500 square foot second floor space provides offices and meeting rooms for the convention hall staff.
