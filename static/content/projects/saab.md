The building consists of an approximately 86,700 square foot high-bay manufacturing assembly area with a 27,000 square foot attached office, break room and employee locker room area.  The load bearing precast also serves as the lateral system for the building.  There is a 3-ton bridge crane in the southeast corner of the building supported by the building structure.  The office main entry has a raised roof with clerestory windows and exposed, tapered, slanted columns on the exterior of the building.

The assembly area consists of load bearing precast around the perimeter and HSS steel columns on the interior.  Joist girders and joists make up the roof framing with steel roof decking.
