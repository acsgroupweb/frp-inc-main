This 24 unit apartment complex  provides needed additional apartments on the Indiana University campus in Bloomington. The building is located with very limited space around the structure. Foundation extensions were limited along one elevation to avoid crossing the property line. The unit consists of cast-in-place concrete columns and steel beams supporting the first level of apartments over a podium level that contains retail shops and a small amount of parking. The apartments are framed with economical wood trusses supported on wood shear walls between the apartment units.
