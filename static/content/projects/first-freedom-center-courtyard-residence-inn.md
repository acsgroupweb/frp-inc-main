Located in downtown Richmond\'s historic Shockoe Slip, this six-story project includes two hotels and an education center on the site where the Virginia General Assembly passed Thomas Jefferson\'s Virginia Statue for Religious Freedom in 1786.

The hotel space consists of a 135 room Courtyard by Marriott and a 75 room Residence Inn by Marriott. The first level incorporates two separate lobbies, meeting spaces, dining and kitchen areas, back of house areas, and the First Freedom Center. The hotel levels are composite slab construction supported on load bearing, cold-formed metal stud walls supported at the second floor by a structural steel transfer level. The entrance of The First Freedom Center is constructed of an open, five story steel framed structure.
