The south expansion of IU's Assembly Hall functions as a replacement to the existing south lobby and adds a new President\'s Club, multiple restroom blocks, monumental stairs, escalators, and a new elevator for upper concourse entrance. New openings were added into the hall to allow for cantilevered seating from the new President\'s Club.
The structural framing system is a combination of a structural steel braced frame and cast-in-place concrete frame construction.
