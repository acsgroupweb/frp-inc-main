This project includes a five level 1050 car parking garage and three stair/elevator towers. The fascia consists of sandblasted cast-in-place concrete bumper walls and a redwood grille between bumper walls. The main stair/elevator tower includes an above grade connector to the University\'s natatorium facility.

A cast-in-place, post-tensioned concrete frame was selected due to its superior durability, while providing a competitive initial construction cost, enhanced driver comfort, and an ambitious construction schedule.
