The six story Alexander in downtown Indianapolis uniquely doubles as a boutique hotel and art museum with the lobbies and public spaces featuring commissioned works of art. The facility features 209 rooms, including 52 extended stay suites, 16,500 sf of event space, a stylish restaurant, and a well equipped fitness center. The project is LEED certified.

The efficient structural system is comprised of a structural steel transfer level that carries cold formed metal framing bearing walls with long span composite deck defining the room layout for the levels above. The event space at ground level dictates long span conditions at the transfer level. A full story depth transfer truss is required between the third and fourth levels. Foundations are conventional spread footings.
