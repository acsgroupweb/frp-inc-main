The new four story structure serves as the gateway to the UIndy campus and as the new home for UIndy wellness related programs. The building also includes a clinic that serves the community. An outdoor caf&#233; area and two-story atrium open the building up to the outdoors. A 140-seat tiered floor classroom allows for larger lecture experiences. An outdoor plaza over the 140-seat classroom is supported by a 60\' long, 15\' tall two-story transfer truss.  A screened mechanical area is provided on the building roof.
