Luddy Hall houses the schools of computer science, intelligent systems engineering, and information and library science departments.  It includes 15 classrooms and labs, lecture hall, multi-use meeting rooms , public space and offices.  
The structure is a four story cast-in-place concrete, two-way slab.  A complicated saw-tooth edge of slab accommodates the fa&#231;ade. A central clerestory atrium with monumental stair required unique detailing to achieve the desired aesthetic.
