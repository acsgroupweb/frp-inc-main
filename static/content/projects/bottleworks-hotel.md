The Bottleworks Hotel was an existing two story factory with a basement that was once owned by the Coca-Cola Company. Built in three phases starting in 1930, it is a reinforced concrete structure with some structural steel components, including riveted steel trusses spanning 80 feet to allow for open space on the first floor. The building was designed in the art deco style and includes many historic features that were preserved as part of the project. Analysis of the existing framing was completed to determine if an extra floor could be added to the building. A new structural steel joist roof was designed to allow the existing roof to be used as hotel space. Analysis of the existing steel trusses was done to allow for the removal of one diagonal to provide space for a hotel corridor. Several existing columns were removed and reinforcement installed to accommodate the architect's layout. A large portion of the existing roof was removed in order to accommodate an exterior courtyard within the interior of the building. A new double elevator was added within the existing building, and existing concrete was repaired where deterioration had occurred over the years.
