The Indiana Live Casino parking garage is a 5-level 1,150 space parking garage adjacent to the casino.  The structural system is a cast-in-place post-tensioned concrete frame.  Post-tensioned concrete was chosen for the durability, security and driver comfort.

Typical bays are 24'-5' x 61'-0'.  A 7' post-tensioned slab is used supported by 14' x 38' beams.  The fa&#231;ade consists of pointed concrete bumper walls with masonry and EIFS accents.  The garage is connected to the adjacent casino via a cantilevered walkway.
