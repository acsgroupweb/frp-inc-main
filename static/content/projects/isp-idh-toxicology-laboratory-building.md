The laboratory is used by the Indiana State Police and Department of Health.  The facility consists of two similar sized three story wings, plus mechanical penthouses.  One wing also has a full basement. The two wings are connected by a knuckle, which houses elevators and facilities common to the two labs.  A reinforced cast-in-place concrete frame was selected for the structural system for economy and to minimize floor vibrations during microscope usage in the research labs.  The labs are programmed with microscopy with magnification levels up to 1000X as well as electron microscopes. 

The project has been LEED certified by the US Green Building Council. High recycled content and regionally manufactured products from regionally harvested materials were factors accounted for in the structural system selection process.
