The Columbus Commons is a two-story steel framed structure that integrates the original steel roof designed by Cesar Pelli over a portion of the structure. The first floor has spaces for retail, food services, offices and an indoor playground as well as retaining the original motion sculpture \"Chaos No. 1\" from the original Commons. The indoor playground, which features the Luckey Climber, is enclosed by a two-story glass pavilion supported by skewed and sloped steel framing. The new second floor constructed under the original building\'s roof provides a multi-purpose performance and activity space. A new stage is highlighted by steel catwalks hung from the original steel trusses above.

The entire east, north and south elevations are comprised of glass including the zig-zag windows at the performance space which are acoustical as well as architectural. All of the insulated glass showcases the new indoor public activities. 

The new Commons was designed to target LEED New Construction Silver Certification.
