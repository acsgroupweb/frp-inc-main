The Indianapolis Museum of Art Newfields project was a $74 million expansion which increased the size of the IMA\'s facility by more than 160,000 square feet in areas such as galleries, art support spaces, banquet, caf&#233; and fine dining spaces.  A museum gift store, education and outreach spaces, and an oval entry pavilion were also added.

The project included three new pavilions - the Gallery Pavilion, the Special Events Pavilion, and the Entry Pavilion or Rotunda.  A new underground parking garage, with landscaping above, is located east of the new pavilions and is connected with an underground tunnel to the Rotunda.

Project Details:  Size 160,000 GSF | Project Completion 2004
