The Deep Green Student Residence includes space for 120 students and encompasses a deep green philosophy in its design. High energy efficiency is paramount in the design pushing the limits of sustainability in the student residence hall. In addition to a goal of LEED Platinum Certification, many objectives of The Living Building Challenge are being incorporated moving closer to a zero ecological footprint. The building rises three stories above grade with a partial basement.
