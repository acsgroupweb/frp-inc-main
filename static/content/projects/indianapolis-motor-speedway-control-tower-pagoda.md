The IMS control tower and support buildings represent some of the newest and most sophisticated facilities dedicated to the sport of auto racing in the United States.  The Control Tower wraps all of this technology into an image that combines the original aesthetic of the pagoda (built in the 1920's) with the more modern glass and concrete control tower constructed in the 1950\'s.  The tower contains race control and security functions for the oval and also houses the private hospitality suites for the Hulman George family who own the speedway.

The structural systems include the roof, floors, columns, elevator core (lateral load carrying system) and foundations.  The structural system presented special challenges resulting from the architect's vision of this unique, signature building for the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.  Most of the structural steel framing system is exposed to view and is part of the building\'s architectural appearance. Long cantilevers at five of the building levels presented intricate framing layouts.  The requirements for panoramic views from the building limit the number of structural members along the building's perimeter. Numerous penetrations in the framing systems were required to accommodate state of the art communication systems.
