This project consists of a two-level, 650-car parking garage located on Indiana University\'s Bloomington campus.  The cladding of the parking structure is limestone.  The structure is a cast-in-place, post-tensioned concrete frame with microsilica concrete, in encapsulated microstand post-tensioned system, and epoxy coated reinforcement to enhance durability.

The grade adjacent to the parking structure allows for entry/exit directly to each level and eliminates the need for a ramp within the garage, while reducing the construction cost.
