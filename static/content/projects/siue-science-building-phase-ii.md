Since the existing Science Building, constructed in 1966, is in use seven days a week to meet lab schedule requirements of the students, the University decided to renovate the existing building and to construct a new Science Building to improve quality of instruction and to attract top faculty and students. Programming incorporated current trends in science education including smaller classrooms, instructional technology, student research, interactive learning and interdisciplinary spaces.

The new Science Building houses several labs dedicated to specific sciences to accommodate specialized spaces such as adjacent cold rooms, warm rooms and environmental growth chambers. A machine shop, animal care facilities, scanning electron microscope facility, darkroom, conference rooms, study areas, and student lounges are also housed within the new Science Building.
