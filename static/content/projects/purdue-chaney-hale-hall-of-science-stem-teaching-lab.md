This state-of-the-art STEM teaching facility features teaching labs for general and organic chemistry, biochemistry, general biology, microbiology, cellular and molecular biology, and anatomy and physiology.  The facility serves roughly 15,000 undergraduate student per year and is centrally located adjacent to the Engineering Mall.  Open collaboration spaces outside of the labs provide opportunities for team-based learning.  

Extensive vibrations analysis were performed to ensure that the cast-in-place elevated floors properly accommodate the sensitive lab equipment.  The project was delivered under a CMAR/GMP process and required early foundation and concrete bid packages to accommodate the schedule.
