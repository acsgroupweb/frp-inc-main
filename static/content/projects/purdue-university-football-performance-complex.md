The Football Performance Complex is the home of the Purdue Boilermakers football team and contains the team locker room, sports medicine, hydrotherapy, nutrition, weight room, equipment storage, team meeting rooms, position meeting rooms and coaches\' offices.  It is centrally located between the team\'s indoor practice field and outdoor practice field, directly adjacent to Ross Ade Stadium providing ideal adjacencies to all team spaces.

To achieve a column free team locker room with 120 lockers, the second and third floor framing clear spans 70\' over the space.  The 10,000 sft weight room utilizes long span roof joists that span 110\' and acoustic roof deck.  An open team hall serves all floors of the building with multiple monumental stairs and custom fa&#231;ade back up framing.  Large roof cantilevers and a steel framed \'Motion P\" create the distinctive fa&#231;ade.
