This operable roof stadium is the home of the Indianapolis Colts and connects to the Indiana Convention Center.  The design is a fieldhouse style with a gabled roof.  Two main 100\' deep super trusses span the length of the stadium and support transverse trusses that carry operable roof panels.  The main stadium bowl is cast-in-place concrete raker beams and columns that support precast tread riser units.  The concourses are cast-in-place concrete beams and slabs.
 
The north end framing is steel truss rakers and composite floor framing to accommodate longer spans in the lower level for convention space.  Pogues Run, a 40\' wide combined over flow sewer, runs beneath the stadium cutting across the south east corner.  A series of 21 eleven feet deep and five feet wide concrete transfer beams transfer the stadium columns over this existing sewer.

Project Details:  Seats 63,000 | Project Completion 2008  | FRP Services:  Structural Engineer of Record for entire facility, excluding roof.
