The new lift station at the corner of 9th and South Streets in downtown Lafayette provides storm water pumping capacity to the treatment plant. The project includes a below-grade precast lift station, and a building which houses the large emergency generator and controls. FRP provided structural design for the building.

The project is located in a historic district of Lafayette, so the building and the site were designed architecturally to blend in with the surrounding homes. The building walls and roof support framing were designed by FRP to provide support for the performance-specified aluminum structure. The aluminum structure can be removed in three main pieces for crane access to the generator, if or when it needs to be replaced.
