Ball State\'s Alumni Center, designed by internationally renowned Pei, Cobb, Freed Partners, houses a major assembly hall space, conference and meeting rooms, a board room, alumni library, and a 47-foot high glass conservatory. The hexagonal shaped assembly hall seats up to 304 banquet guests or 486 theatre style. 
The two story building layout is composed of regular geometric forms including equilateral triangles and circles and a hexagon, leading to complex geometries for the structural steel framing. The tall conservatory space is spanned by architectural exposed structural steel tubular trusses that in turn support a monumental skylight system.
