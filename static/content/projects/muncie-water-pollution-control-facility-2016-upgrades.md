The 2016 upgrades to the Muncie wastewater treatment plant included several structures.  FRP performed structural design for the new UV facility, which was a conventionally reinforced concrete structure with a pre-engineered building above.  The structural design for the wet weather pump station, electrical building, settling tank, and a junction structure was performed in part by FRP staff while with another firm.
