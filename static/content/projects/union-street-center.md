The housing is located on the northeastern edge of the Bloomington campus.  The traditional dormitory-style housing is a mix of four-bedroom and two-bedroom units arranged in four-story buildings.  

The project includes seven separate buildings, one 5-story multi-purpose commons building and six 4-story student housing buildings.  The lower two levels of the commons building is framed with structural steel.  The upper floors of that building and all of the other six buildings utilize cold formed, light gauge metal framing.  The exterior of all the buildings has Indiana limestone, which is the style on Bloomington\'s campus.
