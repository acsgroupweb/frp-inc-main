Welcome Back Chris Martin, PE, SE

In October, FRP was happy to welcome Chris Martin back to the team!  Chris originally worked at FRP from 2000 to 2014 before he moved to Chicago in 2014. While working at a national engineering firm he obtained his SE and almost eight more years of design experience. Chris and his family moved back to the Indianapolis area in September to be close to extended family and started right back with his work family at FRP.  Chris and his wife are expecting their second child in January.  Congratulations Martin family and welcome back, Chris!
