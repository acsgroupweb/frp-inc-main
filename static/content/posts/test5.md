We would like to wish Dave Lash the very best on his retirement, and express our appreciation for his service and dedication to Fink Roberts & Petrie. Dave worked for FRP for 41 years.

Dave had been engaged in the practice of civil engineering since 1980. His 41 years at Fink Roberts & Petrie brought many avenues of experience, from management of the projects and personnel, to keeping our IT running smoothly.  His experience has included site development, transportation, motorsports, site, and hydraulic design and surveying.  Dave worked as a project manager in charge of bridge design from 1981 to 1987 and head of FRP's information technology from 1988 to 1992.  In 1992, Dave was named civil department manager, and in 1997 he was appointed Vice President in charge of operations. Dave's responsibilities also included assisting with project development, quality control, personnel management, and managing the IT responsibilities.

Dave worked on countless bridge projects around the state of Indiana, and also performed civil work on several significant projects, including Knauf Insulation, Ball State University Football Stadium renovation, Ball State University Briner Sports Complex, IUPUI Campus Center and Wabash College Athletic Fields..  Dave, thank you for your dedication and support of FRP.  We wish you the best in your retirement!
