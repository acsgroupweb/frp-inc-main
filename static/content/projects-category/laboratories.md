FRP has performed structural design for multiple research and teaching laboratory facilities. Floor vibrations and sensitive equipment are a primary concern with this type of building. FRP has designed the floor framing systems for several university and private research facilities, in close consultation with specialty vibration consultants, to meet maximum peak velocity restrictions of the anticipated lab equipment. Our coordination with other building systems begins early in design, in order to consider MEP, compressed air distribution systems, and other factors which can have significant impacts on the structural system selection and design.
