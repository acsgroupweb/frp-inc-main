FRP has provided the structural engineering for low to high rise hotel facilities throughout the country. We have experience in several materials and framing schemes, including wood framing, cold-formed metal studs, reinforced CMU bearing walls, structural steel and cast in place concrete. Each system has its own appropriate application, and FRP understands the advantages and disadvantage of each type of system. FRP is especially adept with the fast track process that is common on hospitality projects, and uses a systematic early coordination process for understanding the impact of MEP building systems on the structural systems.
