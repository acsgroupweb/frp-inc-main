Designing parking structures has been one of FRP\'s specialties since 1980. We are dedicated to designing parking facilities that are attractive, functional and durable. FRP\'s experience includes the design of over thirty parking structures using both cast-in-place post-tensioned concrete frames and precast concrete frames. FRP can serve as the prime design firm for a parking structure of any size, or as a consultant providing structural engineering, functional design or durability consultation. We are experienced with the Design-Build approach and conventional project delivery methods, and have earned a reputation for providing well-detailed construction documents.
