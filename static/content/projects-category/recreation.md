FRP has significant experience in the structural design of recreation facilities for both universities and municipalities. These facilities typically include multiple basketball courts, suspended running tracks, climbing walls, weight rooms, and often a natatorium. Long span trusses are a typical structural component in these facilities. FRP coordinates with local fabricators during design to ensure economy and constructibility, considering options for shipping of trusses, connection detailing, and material purchasing. Our experience helps us anticipate and address the unique aspects of recreation projects, such as specialty flooring and the associated slab construction requirements, to help contribute to the project's success.
