FRP has provided structural engineering services for numerous healthcare projects and medical research facilities. Healthcare projects typically include equipment which is sensitive to vibration, and FRP\'s experience in structural design related to vibration control is an asset to these types of projects. Many of these facilities are composed of cast-in-place concrete or structural steel frames with stiffened design in vibration-sensitive areas. FRP also has experience working with specialized vibration consultants, to provide an economical structure which is specifically designed to meet the project vibration criteria. FRP has also reviewed and designed modifications for existing structural systems, for proposed reuse as healthcare facilities.
