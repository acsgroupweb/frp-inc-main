FRP\'s 75+ year history provides us with a solid knowledge base of historical architectural and structural system design, and experience with unique and challenging structures. We have evaluated several antiquated framing systems including clay tile arch floor framing, load bearing brick masonry, and obsolete structural steel shapes and materials. Our in-depth knowledge of the past historical concrete, steel, and masonry design specifications provides important insights into how early vintage buildings were designed, and allows us to better solve the challenges of adaptive reuse. Our work on new high-profile projects and unique structures keeps FRP prepared technically for the design challenges of specialty structures. FRP's experience with special structural conditions includes renovations, additions, and alterations to existing structures, floor capacity studies, seismic evaluations and upgrades, construction engineering, tower and stack structures, buried structures, and assistance with facade support and repair.
