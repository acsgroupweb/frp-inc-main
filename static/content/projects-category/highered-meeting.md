FRP has provided structural engineering for dozens of higher education academic buildings, student unions, dining and alumni centers, and residence halls, on over forty college and university campuses. On several projects, a local architectural firm and a "national design architect" have been engaged by the Owner, so FRP has experience and relationships with multiple national architectural firms through our higher education work. During the early design phase on higher education projects, FRP typically evaluates different structural systems and collateral costs with a detailed side-by-side analysis , to determine what system will achieve the architectural design with the most economy. Depending on the building type and use, systems that FRP has considered and used include wood framing, cold-formed metal studs, reinforced CMU bearing walls, structural steel, and cast-in-place concrete. We also use a systematic early coordination process to ensure that the building structure is coordinated wtih other discipline's design elements, which is particularly important for projects with early structural system bid packages. Nearly all of our higher education academic building projects in the last two decades are LEED Certified, or have some sustainability component incorporated into the design.
