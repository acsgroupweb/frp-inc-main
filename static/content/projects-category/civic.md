FRP has provided structural engineering for several state and municipal government and civic facilities. These facilities have included functions for justice, administration, public gathering spaces, conventions, essential facilities, and transportation, and have ranged in size from small fire stations to civic centers of hundreds-of-thousands of square feet. Many of these projects are architectural icons that have become a great source of pride for their communities.
