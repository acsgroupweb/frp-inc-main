From speculative office buildings to iconic and distinct corporate headquarters, FRP has extensive experience in designing structural systems for the workspace. We have teamed with developers and with nationally renowned architects in helping to create unique and economical workplace environments. FRP was awarded the Indianapolis Monumental Award in 2019 in Architecture and Engineering for our structural design of the Cummins Distribution Headquarters in downtown Indianapolis. Our body of work also includes the North American corporate headquarters for Thomson Consumer Electronics and Emmis Communications. We also specialize in speculative office buildings, working directly for developers with economy and speed of delivery. These projects are often fast tracked, requiring early foundation designs well ahead of the completion of the final MEP and architectural design.
