# Main Text
In the mid 90's frp expanded its speedway experience to the west coast. For three years in a row, FRP led the design effort in three of the most prestigious racetracks built in the country. FRP's scope of services even spread to locations as far away as China.  Locally, FRP completed a number of large-scale civic projects in this decade, including Indianapolis Circle Centre, the Indiana State Office Building, and the second expansion of the Indiana Convention Center. FRP's client list of nationally recognized architects continued to grow as the company's engineering services were extended into a number of other states.
