# Main Text
In September of 1952, Russ Petrie joined the firm and the partnership was renamed Fink Roberts & Petrie.  As a partnership of three, and particularly with George Fink's expertise in steel design and Russ Petrie's expertise in concrete design, the firm began to acquire a great reputation for quality structural designs.  In the mid 1950's, the firm broadened its practice to include highway and bridge design as well as storm sewer design. FRP began to establish its reputation for quality design in the civil engineering field as well. During that period, FRP became the exclusive structural and civil engineer for all projects at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. In 1958, the firm was incorporated.
