# Main Text
In the 1980's and 90's, the industry began to alter its traditional ways of project delivery. Fast-track construction, construction management, and design/build were new processes with more demanding schedules and delivery expectations.  FRP was early to adapt and earn respect for efficiently working with these new delivery methods, strengthening the company's position for selection on complex and high-profile projects.  During these two decades, FRP continued to provide structural engineering for numerous large-scale, complex projects throughout central Indiana and the surrounding states for many repeat clients. Athletic facilities and stadiums were added to FRP's growing portfolio, the most significant of which being the new Hoosier Dome for the new NFL football team in Indianapolis.
