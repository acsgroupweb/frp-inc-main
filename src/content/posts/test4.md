FRP teamed with USI Consultants, Inc. and Metric Environmental, LLC for the 2021 CANstruction competition at the Indiana State Fair to support Gleaners Food Bank of Indiana. Our structure is made up of 5,249 canned goods that will be donated to this great cause at the end of the competition.

Entries to this year’s contest centered around Iconic Indiana! Our entry celebrated Indiana as the racing capital of the world showcasing the IMS’s pagoda and famous brick finish line. Merging the past to present it also featured one of Wilbur Shaw’s roadsters breaking through the checkered flag. Shaw was an Iconic Hoosier being a three-time Indy 500 winner and visionary. FRP’s Nathan King brought it to life by taking 2-D sketches and ideas to build a 3-D model in SketchUp. The team then spent over 7 hours building the can structure!

Thank you to all the team members who made this project a real success!
